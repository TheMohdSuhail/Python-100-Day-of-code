Python Sets

Sets are unordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly bracket{}.
Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. Sets do not contain duplicate items
Example:

'''

info = {"Carla",19,False, 5.9, 19}
print(info)
