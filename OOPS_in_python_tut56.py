Introduction to Objet-opriented programming

Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python: In programming languages, mainly
there are two apporaches that are used to write program or code.

1). Procedural Programming
2). Object-Oriented Programming

The procedure we are following till now is the "Procedureal Programming" approch. So, in
this session, we will learn about Object Orientd Programming (OOP). The basic idea of
object-oriented progarmming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and object to represent
real-world concepts and entitie.

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and
methods that an object of that class will have. Properties are the data or state of an
object and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.


An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods.
For Example, you could create a class called "Person" that has properties such as name
and age, and methods such as speak() and walk(). Each instance of the Person class would
be a unique object with its own name and age, but they would all have the a same methods to 
speak and walk.


Encapsulation :-
_______________

One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, which means that the internal
state of an objeact is hidde and can only be accessd or modified through the object's
methods. This helps to protect the object's data and prevent(rokta hai) it from being
modified in unexpected ways.


Inheritance :-
______________

Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance, which allows new classes to be created
that inherit the properites and methods of an existing class. This allows for code reuse
and make it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality ot existing classes.

Polymorphism :-
_______________

Polymorphims is also supported in Python, which means that objects of different classes can
be treated as if they were objects of a common class. This  allows for greater flexibility
in code and makes it easier to write it easier to write code that can wrok with multiple
types of objects.

In Summary, OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepets and entities using
classes and objects encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, and write more flexible
code through polymorphism.
