''' A Data type convert into another data its call "DataType"
 Data Type also two type
 1. Exlicity :- When we conver a data type into another data type its called exlicity
 ex : a = " 5 "
 print(int(a))
  conditon convertion :-  The data type must be correct
  a = "7" its can change
  a = "5hello"

  2. Implicity :- In implicity we can not need change data type into another data type
  ex. :- a = 1
        b = 5.6
        c = a+b
        print(c)

'''
# Expicity Example
a = "5"
b = " 6 "
print(int(a)+int(b))

# Imlicity Example

v=4
n=2.6
print(v+n)
