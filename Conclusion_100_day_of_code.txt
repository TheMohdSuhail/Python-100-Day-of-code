This is just the beginning of your journey with Python. There are many more topics to
explore, including machine learning, web development, game development, and more


Where to go from here:

To continue your learning journey, consider exploring the following resoureces:


● Python books : There are many execellent books on Python that can help you deepen your
knowldge and skills. Some Popular options include "Python Crash Course " by Eric Matthes,
" Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, and "Fluent Python"
by Luciano Ramalho. I would also like to recommend " Hands on Machine Learning Book
by Auelien Geron"

● YouTube Projects: There are many YouTube projects availabe which can be watched after you
have some basic understanding of Python

● Python Communities : There are many online communities where you can connect with other
Python learners and experts, ask questions, and share your knowledge. Some popular options
include the Python Subreddit, the Python Discord server, and Pythn community on Stack Overflow.

● GitHub repositories: GitHub is a great resource for finding Python projects, libraries,
and code snippets. Some useful repositories to check out include "awesome-python"
( a curated list of Python resources), "scikit-learn" ( a machine learning library),
and "django" ( a web development framework).
