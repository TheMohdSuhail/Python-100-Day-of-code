# A String is essential a sequence of character also called an array. Thus we can access the elements of this array.
fruit = "Mango"
len1 = len(fruit)
print("Mango is a ", len1, "letter word .")
# Slicing in String
# Slicing star zero index with square braceks
# if i not write zero then python star defoult zero
# Colon(:) Left side Starting point colon just right side ending point and colon last point is step point
# We can use negative slicing
# Ex. [-1]

st = "Hello World"
print(st[-5:-1])
# print(len(st))
nm = "Harry"
print(nm[-4:-2]) # I gusse print hoga " MNar "
